  <h1>Comic-Con Anniversary Reflection</h1>

  <p>This July will mark a very important anniversary for me. This marks my tenth consecutive year attending the San Diego Comic-Con. I feel fortunate to have been able to attend so many with my family. This event has not only been fun but also helped shape me to who I am today.</p>

  <p>Here are some of my favorite experiences from attending, and the years they are from:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>2015</strong><br>

    <li><strong>2016</strong><br>

    </li>
    <li><strong>2017</strong><br>
      <img src="IMG_4594.JPG" alt="Comic-Con 2017 - LEGO Marvel Wall">
    </li>
    <li><strong>2019</strong><br>

    </li>
    <li><strong>2022</strong><br>

    </li>
    <li><strong>2023</strong><br>
      <img src="IMG_3724.jpg" alt="Comic-Con 2023 - Star Wars Booth with Darth Vader and Leia">
    </li>
    <li><strong>2024</strong><br>
      <img src="" alt="Comic-Con 2024 - Voltron Display and Attendee">
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Over the years, attendance at the San Diego Comic-Con has increased significantly.</p>

  <p>Sometimes it brings in hundreds of thousands more than can even attend the conference and participate in what are called off-sites, which are typically free to go to and will give out free swag to visitors.</p>
