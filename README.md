  <h1>Comic-Con Anniversary Reflection</h1>

  <p>This July will mark a very important anniversary for me. This marks my tenth consecutive year attending the San Diego Comic-Con. I feel fortunate to have been able to attend so many with my family. This event has not only been fun but also helped shape me to who I am today.</p>

  <h2>Comic-Con Culture</h2>

  <p>Over the years, attendance at the San Diego Comic-Con has increased significantly.</p>

  <p>Sometimes it brings in hundreds of thousands more than can even attend the conference and participate in what are called off-sites, which are typically free to go to and will give out free swag to visitors.</p>
